                            These days, we do just about everything online—and that includes shopping. Which is
                            why there’s never been a better time to be in ecommerce.
                        </p>

                            Nowadays, if you’re selling anything—whether that’s sneakers, salad dressing, or
                            something in between—you need to hop on board the ecommerce website train. An
                            ecommerce site offers you the chance to build your brand, connect with more
                            customers, and sell more products—but only if you’ve got the right website design.
                        </p>
                        <p class="blog-section-box-content__text">
                            Web design is critical when creating an ecommerce website. Good ecommerce web design
                            is all about using the right colors, fonts, images, words and graphics to convince
                            visitors to make a purchase. Your ecommerce website design should attract potential
                            customers, provide great user experience and present your shop in the best light.
                        </p>

                            So, not only does your site have to look good and feel on-brand, but it also needs
                            to drive your website visitors to take action and, you know… buy your products. But
                            how, exactly, do you do that? How do you design the kind of ecommerce site that will
                            have products flying off your virtual shelves?

                            One of the top rules you should keep in mind during the ecommerce design process is

                            like the DNA of your ecommerce business; it’s who you are as a company, what you’re
                            about, and how you’re different from your competitors—and it plays a huge part in
                            building a connection with your audience and driving sales.

                            well-designed, and makes the process of shopping easy, straightforward, and

                            During the design process, put yourself in your visitor’s shoes. What kind of layout

                            way that makes sense for the end user? How can you simplify the checkout process?
                            When you think like your customer, you can anticipate what they want from your
                            ecommerce store—and then design your site in order to meet those needs.

                            The basis of an ecommerce site is that you are asking your website visitors to
                            purchase something from you. And, as a result, you’re asking them to turn over
                            sensitive information, like their credit card information. Which they’re not going
                            to feel comfortable doing if your website doesn’t look profesh.

                            customers—and developing that trust is a must if you want your ecommerce store to
                            succeed.

                            What do we mean by professional? Your website shouldn’t have any typos or
                            misspellings. Your font, color palette, and footer design should be consistent from
                            page to page. All your product links and buttons should work. Your photos shouldn’t
                            look like you snapped them on an old iPhone 5 and your overall site design shouldn’t
                            look like you swiped it from Geocities circa 1997.

                            The point is, if you want your customers to take you seriously, you need to show

                            web design.

                            When you’re designing your ecommerce site, look for ways to show your potential
                            customers the positive feedback you’ve gotten from your existing customers. Add a
                            ratings section where people can rate your products (and then get as many 5 star
                            reviews as you can). Add a testimonials section where you feature customer photos
                            with a quote or two about what a great experience they had working with you. Ask
                            customers to review your products—and what they like about them—and then add them to
                            your blog.

                            trustworthy you’ll appear—and the more your conversions will go up as a result.

                            Otherwise you might not convince those valuable mobile visitors that your site is
